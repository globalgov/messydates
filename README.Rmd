## Why this package?

Existing packages for working with dates in R expect them to be _tidy_.
That is, they should be in or coercible to the standard ISO format `yyyy-mm-dd`.

But dates are often **_messy_**.
Sometimes we only know the year when something happened,
leaving other components of the date, such as the month or day, _unspecified_.
This is often the case with historical dates, for instance.
Sometimes we can only say _approximately_ when an event occurred,
that it occurred _before_ or _after_ a certain date,
or we recognise that our best estimate comes from a _dubious_ source.
Other times there exists a _set_ or _range_ of possible dates for an event.

Although researchers generally recognise this messiness,
many feel expected to force artificial precision or unfortunate imprecision 
on temporal data to proceed with analysis.
For example, if we only know something happened in `2021`,
then we might revert to a panel data design
_even if greater precision is available_,
or opt to replace this date with the start of that year (`2021-01-01`),
assuming that erring on the earlier (or later) side is more justifiable than 
a random date within that month or year.

However, this can create inferential issues when timing or sequence is important.
`{messydates}` assists with this problem by retaining and working
with various kinds of date imprecision.

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

## A quick overview

`{messydates}` implements for R the extended annotation standard for dates,
the Extended Date/Time Format (EDTF) outlined in [ISO 8601-2_2019(E)](https://www.iso.org/standard/70908.html).
`{messydates}` introduces a new `mdate` class that embeds these annotations,
and offers a set of methods for constructing and
coercing into and from the `mdate` class,
as well as tools for working with such 'messy' dates.

```{r comparison, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pkg_comparison <- tibble::tribble(~Example, ~OriginalDate,
                                    "Normal date", "2010-01-01",
                                    "Future date", "2599-12-31",
                                    "Written date", "First of February, two thousand and twenty-one",
                                    "Historical date", "476",
                                    "Era date", "33 BC",
                                    "Approximate date", "2012-01-12~",
                                    "Uncertain date", "2001-01-01?",
                                    "Unspecified date", "2012-01",
                                    "Censored date", "..2012-01-12", 
                                    "Range of dates", "2019-11-01:2020-01-01",
                                    "Set of dates", "2021-5-26, 2021-11-19, 2021-12-4") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(base = as.Date(OriginalDate),
                lubridate = suppressWarnings(lubridate::as_date(OriginalDate)),
                messydates = messydates::as_messydate(OriginalDate))
```

```{r compprint, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
kbl(pkg_comparison) %>% kable_styling("striped") %>% 
  column_spec(3, 
              color = ifelse((paste(pkg_comparison$base) == paste(pkg_comparison$messydates)),
                           "black", "red")) %>% 
  column_spec(4, 
              color = ifelse((paste(pkg_comparison$lubridate) == paste(pkg_comparison$messydates)),
                           "black", "red")) %>% 
  column_spec(5, 
              color = ifelse((paste(pkg_comparison$messydates) == paste(pkg_comparison$messydates)),
                           "black", "red"))
```

As can be seen in the table above,
other date/time packages in R do not handle 'messy' dates well.
Normal "yyyy-mm-dd" structures or other date formats that can easily be
coerced into this structure are usually not a problem.

However, some syntaxes are entirely ignored,
such as historical dates and dates from other eras (e.g. BCE),
as well as written dates, frequently used in historical texts or treaties.

Other times, existing packages return a date, but strip away any annotations 
that express uncertainty or approximateness,
introducing artificial precision.

And sometimes returning only a single date means ignoring other information included.
We see this here in how only the end of the censored date,
only the start of the date range, or the first in the set of dates is returned.
Sometimes date components even seem guessed, such as how `2021-01` (January 2021)
is assumed to be 1 _December_ 2021 by `{lubridate}`.

So only `{messydates}` enables researchers to retain all this information.
But most analysis does still expect some precision in dates to work.

## Working with messy dates

The first way that `{messydates}` assists researchers that use dates in `mdate` class
is to provide methods for converting back into common date classes 
such as `Date`, `POSIXct`, and `POSIXlt`.
It is thus fully compatible with packages such as `{lubridate}` and `{anydate}`.

As messy date annotations can indicate multiple possible dates,
`{messydates}` allows e.g. ranges or sets of dates to be 
unpacked or expanded into all compatible dates.

Since most methods of analysis or modelling expect single date observations,
we offer ways to resolve this multiplicity when coercing `mdate`-class objects
into other date formats.
For example, researcher might explicitly choose to favour
the `min()`, `max()`, `mean()`, `median()`, or even a `random()` date.
This greatly facilitates research transparency by demanding a conscious choice from researchers,
as well as supporting robustness checks by enabling description or inference across
dates compatible with the messy annotated date.

```{r work}
resolve_mdate <- pkg_comparison %>% 
  dplyr::select(messydates) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(min = as.Date(messydates, min),
         median = as.Date(messydates, median),
         max = as.Date(messydates, max))
```

```{r workprint, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
kbl(resolve_mdate) %>% kable_styling("striped")
```

As can be seen in the table above, all 'precise' dates are respected as such,
and returned no matter what 'resolution' function is given.
But for messy dates, the choice of function can make a difference.
Where only a year is given, e.g. `0476` or `-0033`,
we draw from all the days in the year.
The minimum is the first of January and the maximum the 31st of December.
Dates are also drawn from a set or range of dates when given.

When only an approximate or censored date is known,
then depending on whether the whole date or just a component of the date is annotated,
then a range of dates is imputed based on some window (by default 3 years, months, or days),
and then a precise date is resolved from that.

This translation via an expanded list of compatible dates is fast, robust, and extensible,
allowing researchers to use messy dates in an analytic strategy that uses any other package.
